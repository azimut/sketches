# sketches

These are some visual sketches I made while learning about digital art.

## Examples

![nature-of-code/01.vectors/03.random-acceleration.random.ps](imgs/noc1.png "random acceleration") ![nature-of-code/01.vectors/03.random-acceleration.attractor.ps](imgs/noc2.png "acceleration with repulsion")

## Restrictions

I won't develop a framework for this repo. I'll stick to the features the techstack I am experimenting with has.

## Postscript Notes

- Missing features: normal distribution, noise functions (1D or 2D), vectors.
