# sketches

These are some visual sketches I made while learning about digital art.

## Examples

<p float="left" align="middle">
  <img src="imgs/noc1.png" width="100" />
  <img src="imgs/noc2.png" width="100" />
</p>

## Restrictions

I won't develop a framework for this repo. I'll stick to the features the techstack I am experimenting with has.

## Postscript Notes

- Missing features: normal distribution, noise functions (1D or 2D), vectors.
